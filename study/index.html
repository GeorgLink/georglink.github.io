<p><em> Hi, my name is Georg Link and I'm a PhD Candidate at UNO.<br />
  Today, I call on you to help me out by participating in my experiment.
  As a member of the student body, I have fulfilled an implicit social contract
  by helping other students in their research by participating. I hope that you will
   do the same for me and participate in my study, so that you may find participants
   when you get to do your own study someday.</em></p>

<h2>Information about the study</h2>
<p>You are invited to participate in this research study. The information here
is provided to help you make an informed decision whether or not to participate.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.</p>

<h3 id="what-will-i-have-to-do">What will I have to do?</h3>
<p>If you decide to participate in the study, you will be asked to participate
in up to three 60-minute sessions. We will offer several sessions and you can
choose the most convenient time. During the first three sessions, you will be
using a software prototype on a computer that we provide. The prototype will be
the same in each session but content you are interacting with will be constantly
changing. We will be tracking your behavior within the software and ask you at
the end of each session to answer a few questions. The optional fourth session
would be an interview about your experience using the prototype.</p>

<h3 id="what-data-will-you-collect">What data will you collect?</h3>
<p>Participation in the study is voluntary. You have the right to change your
mind at any time. You may stop participating in the study without penalty and
without giving a reason. Your enrollment status or class performance will be
unaffected by participating. Your participation will be anonymous and we collect
your personal information only to communicate with you about scheduling sessions
and to provide you with an Amazon gift card as a token of appreciation for your
participation. The value of the Amazon gift card will be determined by how many
sessions you participated in.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-in-gift-cards-do-i-get-in-return">How much in gift cards do I get in return?</h3>
<p>Your gift card amount will be determined based on your participation,
performance, and chance: (1) Depending on how often you participate, you will
receive $10 for participating once, $20 total for participating twice,
and $35 total for participating three times. (2) You can earn an additional $10 based
on performance. (3) Each time you participate, you also enter in a raffle for
one of seven additional $50 on top of your participation minimum. Your odds will
depend on how many participate; we expect 70 participants. <strong>All together, you can
receive up to $95.</strong></p>
