<h2>Information about the study</h2>
<p>You are invited to participate in this research study. The information here
is provided to help you make an informed decision whether or not to participate.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.</p>

<h3>What will I have to do?</h3>
<p>If you decide to participate in the study, you will be asked to participate
in up to three 60-minute sessions. We will offer several sessions and you can
choose the most convenient time. During the three sessions, you will be
using a software prototype on a computer that we provide. The prototype will be
the same in each session but content you are interacting with will be constantly
changing. We will be tracking your behavior within the software and ask you at
the end of each session to answer a few questions.</p>

<h3>What data will you collect?</h3>
<p>Participation in the study is voluntary. You have the right to change your
mind at any time. You may stop participating in the study without penalty and
without giving a reason. Your enrollment status or class performance will be
unaffected by participating. Your participation will be anonymous and we collect
your personal information only to communicate with you about scheduling sessions
and to provide you with an Amazon gift card as a token of appreciation for your
participation. The value of the Amazon gift card will be determined by how many
sessions you participated in.</p>

<h3>How much in gift cards do I get?</h3>
<p>Your gift card amount will be determined based on your participation,
performance, and chance: (1) Depending on how often you participate, you will
receive $10 for participating once, $20 total for participating twice,
$35 total for participating three times, $55 total for participating four times.
(2) In each session, you can earn an additional $10 if you make it to the top
position of a leader board and $5 for second place. (3) Each time you
participate, you also enter in a raffle for
one of seven additional $50 on top of your participation minimum. Your odds will
depend on how many participate; we expect 40 participants.
<strong>All together, you can receive up to $145.</strong></p>

<h3>What gift cards can I choose from?</h3>

<p>We are planning to offer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Amazon</li>
  <li>MavMONEY</li>
  <li>Walmart</li>
</ul>

<h3>What about …?</h3>
<p>The results of the research study will not be of use to you, and you will
not be told individual results. We may share the full anonymous research dataset
with collaborators. If you like to receive a final study report, you are free to
let us know. If you have any questions about the rights as a research
participant, please contact the principal investigator Georg Link via
glink@unomaha.edu, the secondary investigator Vinod Ahuja via
vahuja@unomaha.edu, or the faculty supervisor: Dr. Matt Germonprez via
germonprez@gmail.com.</p>


<h3>How can I participate?</h3>
<p>You can only participate if you consent. By clicking “I consent to
participate” within the software prototype, you acknowledge that the information
in this consent form was explained to you, you have read and understood the
consent form, that your questions have been answered, and that you decided to
participate. You will receive a copy of this consent form via email when we
confirm your scheduled sessions.</p>
